We have added in ColdFusion samples along with JSP samples.

Some of the documentation included in this SDK may be incorrect because of this change.

The directory structure *was*:

samples/
	command-line/
	webapps/
		OnlineOrder/
		OnlineReview/
		SimpleSample/

and now *it is*
samples/
	command-line/
	webapps/
		ColdFusion/	
			OnlineOrder/
			OnlineReview/
			SimpleSample/
		Java Server Pages/
			OnlineOrder/
			OnlineReview/
			SimpleSample/
